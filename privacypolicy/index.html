Key Points
It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:
NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.
CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE: In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located</p>

    <p>PRIVACY POLICY – CANADA
When you install the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK App and register on the Site, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device’s address book (collectively, “Personal Information”). A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other personal information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:
a. notify you when your contacts become active on CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK,
b. indicate which of your contacts is already a CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK user,
c. correctly display the name of each contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received.
In addition, we may also create a function in the future that will use this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.
The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a “historical backup”. If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.
Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK user ID.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR – see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 12 months.
Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.
23.1 CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile Inc. (“CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile”) is strongly committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Please carefully read the following Privacy Policy. In order to ensure your privacy, personal information CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile collects from its customers, as well as visitors to its website located at www.canpacinvestments.com (“Site”), is used only in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. “Personal information” includes information about an identifiable individual, presented in any form, such as: age, name, ID number(s), income, ethnic origin, opinions, evaluations, social status, disciplinary actions, credit records, loan records, medical records, but does not include the name, title, business address and telephone number of an employee of an organization.

The Site may provide hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that may, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or to a third party website not controlled by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile. Such hyperlinked third party websites may collect and disclose information different than this Site. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these third party web sites, and CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.
PRINCIPLE #3 — CONSENT
The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.
I. In certain circumstances, personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, where collection or use is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; where used or disclosed in the case of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual; where personal information is publicly available as defined by regulation; where collection with knowledge or consent might compromise the availability or accuracy of the information and the collection relates to investigation of a breach of agreement or contravention of law; or to comply with a subpoena, warrant or court order.
II. Where required, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will generally seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified).
III. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will make a reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for which the information will be used. To make the consent meaningful, the purposes will be stated in such a manner that the individual can reasonably understand how the information will be used or disclosed.
IV. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes.
V. The form of consent sought by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of information disclosed. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent will generally be appropriate when the information is less sensitive.
VI. An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal. In order to withdraw consent, an individual must provide notice to CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile in writing.
VII. With respect to personal information already collected by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile prior to the publication of this Privacy Policy, this Policy will constitute reasonable notice to CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s current customers of the purposes and uses for which such personal information has been collected. Should an individual object to these ongoing uses or disclosures, consent may be withdrawn upon providing notice to CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile in writing.
PRINCIPLE #4 — LIMITING COLLECTION
The collection of personal information will be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile. Information will be collected by fair and lawful means.
I. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile collects personal information from its customers for the purposes described under Principle #2.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may also collect personal information from such third parties as credit bureaus, employers or personal references or other third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.
III. The Site uses a feature of Internet web browsers called a cookie, which is a file that is sent to your browser from the Site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie assigns a unique identification code to your computer in order to collect anonymous information. On this Site, cookies are used to help us track visitors, conduct research and improve our content and services.
IV. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s cookies do not collect personal information. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile only collects personal information if you knowingly and willingly provide such information.
V. You may set your Internet web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. If you prevent a cookie from being sent, you may limit the functionality of the Site.
PRINCIPLE #5 — LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION
Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as otherwise required or permitted by law. Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
I. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may collect, use or disclose personal information without the individual’s knowledge or consent in certain circumstances as described in Principle #3.1.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may disclose a customer’s personal information to:
a. a person involved in the development, promotion, marketing or enhancement of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile services;
b. emergency services in an emergency situation;
c. a person, who, in the reasonable estimation of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile, is an agent of the customer;
d. third party affiliates for administrative purposes (for example, customer billing, marketing, etc.); and
a. any other third party, upon receiving the consent of the customer or as required by law.
III. Such disclosures may in some cases be to recipients outside of Canada.
IV. Personal information may also be disclosed in connection with a sale, transfer or reorganization of one or more of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s businesses, in which case CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will require that any personal information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.
V. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will retain personal information that has been used to make a decision about an individual long enough to allow the individual access to the information after the decision has been made, and, in the event of an access request or a challenge, long enough to exhaust any recourse an individual may have under the law.
PRINCIPLE #6 — ACCURACY
Personal information will be updated as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be collected and used.
I. The extent to which personal information will be updated will depend upon the use of the information, taking into account the interests of the individual. Information will be sufficiently accurate, complete, and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about the individual.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will not routinely update personal information unless such a process is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.
III. Personal information that is used on an ongoing basis, including information that is disclosed to third parties, will generally be accurate and up-to-date to the best of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s knowledge, unless limits to the requirement for accuracy are clearly set out.
PRINCIPLE #7 — SAFEGUARDS
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will use reasonable efforts to protect personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
I. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security features to ensure the privacy of personal and anonymous information on its network. In addition, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile has implemented strict operations guidelines to safeguard customer privacy at every level of its organization. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages (or any other damages or liability of any kind whatsoever, whether as a result of negligence or otherwise) that result from a lapse in compliance with this Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile protects all personal information regardless of the format in which it is held. The methods of protection include:

b. organizational measures, such as security clearances and limiting access on a “need to know” basis;
c. technological measures, such as the use of passwords and encryption.
III. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile makes their employees aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile employees are governed by non-disclosure obligations. These obligations prohibit disclosure or use of any confidential or personal information except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

I. Upon written request, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will inform an individual whether or not the organization holds personal information about that individual, and will provide that individual with a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in his or her file.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will allow the individual access to his or her personal information once the individual has provided CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile with a written request application. The application will include sufficient information to permit CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile to provide an account of the existence, use, and disclosure to any third parties of this personal information. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will use the application only for this purpose.
III. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will respond to an individual’s written request within 30 days, unless this period is extended in accordance with applicable legislation, in which case notice will be sent to the individual within 30 days regarding the extension, the reasons for it and the individual’s rights in connection with it. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will assist any individual who informs it that they need assistance in preparing a request. While the response will typically be provided at no cost to the individual, depending on the nature of the request and the amount of information involved, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile reserves the right to impose a cost. In these circumstances, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will inform the individual of the approximate cost to provide the response and proceed upon payment. The requested information will be provided or made available in a form that is generally understandable.
IV. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will be as specific as possible in providing an account of third parties to which it has disclosed personal information about an individual. When it is not possible to provide a list of the organizations to which it has actually disclosed information about an individual, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed information about the individual.
V. In certain instances, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will not be able to provide the individual access to his or her personal information. Where permitted, the reasons for denying access will be provided to the individual. This will be done upon the individual’s request, unless CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile is required by law to provide such written reasons.

    <p>PRIVACY POLICY – UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
When you install the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK App and register on the Site, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device’s address book (collectively, “Personal Information”). A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other personal information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:
a. notify you when your contacts become active on CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK,
b. indicate which of your contacts is already a CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK user,
c. correctly display the name of each contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received.
In addition, we may also create a function in the future that will use this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.
The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a “historical backup”. If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.
Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK user ID.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR – see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.
Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile VoIP Inc. and its affiliated entities (“CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile”) are committed to your privacy. We obey all laws and regulations in the United States applicable to our use and disclosure of your information. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not trade, sell, or disclose to any third party any form of PII (as defined below) without your consent and we will not disclose or make available any PII to any third parties seeking to market third party products without your consent. We have set forth this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect and use information from our customers who use services and products from CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile (“Customers”) and from visitors to our Web sites and from potential customers who have communicated, made contact, or interacted with CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile (“Visitors”), both in connection with online and offline services and products offered by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile.
24.1. Collection of Information
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile shall collect personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name, physical address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, and other personal information (collectively, “PII”), from Customers when initiating service and in connection with the provision or marketing of products and services. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may collect PII from Visitors in connection with any visit to our Web sites, any communication about our services and products, or other transactions or interactions with CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may also collect non-personally identifiable information from Customers and Visitors regarding usage of our services or our Web site (“Non-PII”).

“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a Web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that Web site. Many Web sites use cookies for these purposes. We may use cookies to customize your visit to our Web sites and for other purposes to make your visit
In addition to our cookies, we and our vendors and contractors may also use clear gifs, Web beacons, and third party cookies to improve the performance of our Web sites, provide certain features such as advertising, or to anonymously track usage of our Web sites and the online activity of users. In addition, we may use such devices in our HTML-based emails to track the usage of such emails in much the same manner as usage of our Web sites is tracked.
You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer, including third party cookies, or flush them from your browser by adjusting your Web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Web site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.
24.2. Anti-Spyware Policy
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and a consumer’s experience online. Therefore, we forbid any CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile employee, agent, partner, affiliate, or contractor from intentionally deploying or using Spyware (as defined in this policy) on behalf of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile. Spyware refers to any executable software application that is installed on a user’s personal computer and covertly gathers and transmits PII through the user’s Internet connection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Cookies and Web beacons are not considered Spyware. Spyware may gather PII, such as e-mail addresses and credit card information, and may even alter personal computer settings. Intentional use of Spyware by any CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile employee, agent, partner, or affiliate on CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s behalf will not be tolerated and will be considered grounds for dismissal, contract termination, and/or loss of payment.
24.3. Use of Information
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will use PII to (1) market products and services to Customers and Visitors that CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile believes may be of interest to them, (2) provide services and products requested by Customers and Visitors and (3) enable its vendors, contractors and partners to provide and assist CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile in the marketing and provision of such services and products to CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile, Customers, or Visitors or to participate in joint marketing offers with CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile. In our contracts with vendors, contractors and partners, we require them to protect PII and to limit their use of such information to the purposes for which it is provided. They may not use this information for their own independent marketing purposes. If you purchase products and services offered jointly by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile and one of our partners, PII may be received and shared by both CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile and our partner. Each company’s privacy policy may apply. However, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties unless they are involved in processing payments for services that you have purchased from CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile only works with partners whom we believe maintain high standards with respect to privacy and consumer rights.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may also use and disclose PII to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of our service or network, to investigate fraud or violations of our EndUserLicenseAgreement, as required by courts or administrative agencies or in connection with a sale, merger, or reorganization of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s business.
24.4. CPNI
In the course of providing services to you, we collect and maintain certain customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”). CPNI includes the types of services you currently purchase, related usage and billing information for those services. Your telephone number, name, and address are not CPNI. We value our relationships with our customers and are committed to respecting and protecting your CPNI. Accordingly, we do not sell, trade, or share your CPNI, including your calling records outside of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile or with anyone not authorized to offer our products or services, or to perform functions on our behalf except as authorized by you or required by law. Generally, we can use your CPNI to offer additional services to you, and for billing and collections purposes. We can also disclose your CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons, including in response to subpoenas and court orders, without your prior knowledge or consent. We can also use CPNI to investigate fraud and to prevent violation of our Terms of Service and unlawful use of our network, services, and other customers.
24.5. Security
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security features to make reasonable efforts to ensure the privacy of information on its network. In addition, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile has implemented operations guidelines to ensure Customer and Visitor privacy is safeguarded throughout its organization. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies becomes available. However, no system or service can give a 100% guaranty of security, especially a service that relies upon the public Internet. Therefore, you acknowledge the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to your information when using or accessing our services and our network.
24.6. Communications
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties private e-mail, conversations, or other communications that are transmitted using CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile services except as required to ensure proper operation of services or as otherwise authorized by law, or with your prior consent.
You should be aware that any PII which you voluntarily include and transmit through publicly accessible forums (i.e., such as chat rooms, blogs, instant messages, listservs) may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile is unable to control such uses of your PII, and by using such services, you assume the risk that the PII provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

  <li>
    <p>SECURITY POLICY
This privacy policy explains how CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile treats personally identifiable information that CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile collects and receives. Personally identifiable information is information about our customers that can identify them, such as name, address, e-mail address or phone number.
This policy also applies to our use of what our industry calls “Customer Proprietary Network Information” (CPNI). CPNI relates to the use of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile voice services. It includes the length of calls; the phone numbers that customers call and similar information. CPNI does not include personally identifiable information such as name, telephone number and e-mail address.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile does not own or control, or to people CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile does not employ or manage. However, when CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile uses companies, agents, contractors or other third parties to perform services on its behalf, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile requires that they protect CPNI and personally identifiable information consistent with this policy.
25.1. Accessing Private Information
A central feature of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s product is its ability to integrate a user’s telephony and e-mail systems into a unified service. In order to accomplish this, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile’s software may access contact lists maintained by third-party products such as Microsoft Outlook. We do not use this information for any purpose other than to enable these features. We will never contact anyone in your address book, nor allow anyone inside or outside of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile to have access to this information.
Other information we collect may be used to protect customers, employees and property against fraud, theft or abuse, to conduct surveys and to maintain good customer relations.
25.2. Information We Collect
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile collects personally identifiable information and CPNI when customers register with CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile, when customers use CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile products or services, when customers visit CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile Web pages or the Web pages of certain CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile partners and when customers choose to enter promotions or sweepstakes or participate in a survey.
When a customer registers for a CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile account, we require name, gender, address, contact number, e-mail address and a password.
Customers may also provide information in response to surveys conducted by CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile either online or offline. If this information is connected directly to your personally identifiable information, it is personally identifiable information under this policy. In addition, customers may provide CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile with personal information when they interact with us. For example, customers may provide such information when requesting or using CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile customer service.
25.3. Use of Information
25.3.1. Administrative Messages
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile uses personally identifiable information to create and maintain accounts, including the delivery of important administrative messages such as service announcements, privacy policy updates, terms of service updates, rate plan changes, balance notifications and account status notifications regarding that particular account (by e-mail, text message, call from customer service or any combination). Please note that when you do not opt in to marketing offers described herein, we will continue to send you this important account-related information.
25.3.2. Information Sharing and Disclosure
I. We may share information with companies that work on behalf of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile to provide a product or service that has been requested. We share this information only when it is required to deliver the service in question, and any company working with CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile to deliver such a service does not have a right to use the information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us in delivering that product or service.
II. You may elect to participate in CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile-sponsored contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other promotions and product or service opportunities that CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may sponsor. If CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile should use third parties to deliver these promotions, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile will share only the information required to allow them to do their job and will not allow the third party to use information for any other purposes without appropriate permission.
III. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against legal claims.
IV. We share information when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile terms of use or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.
V. We will transfer information about our customers if CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile is acquired by or merged with another company.
25.3.3. Ability to Update or Delete Information
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile gives you the ability to update and delete personal information you have provided to us. Please note that any information that we have obtained may remain in backup storage for some period of time after a deletion request. This may be the case even though we will not use such information. Further, we retain call and other records consistent with legal requirements.
25.4. PERSONALIZATION, COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND AGGREGATE DATA
This section identifies how CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile and third parties use Web technologies such as cookies and Web beacons, and identifies how your IP address may be seen or used as you use the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile service. These technologies are generally used to improve or personalize a service in some way so that it is easier to use. Cookies are small text files placed on a computer’s hard drive by a Web site when a customer visits that site. Cookies are used within the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile service as follows:
25.4.1. Cookies identify a customer’s computer and record customer preferences and other data about the visit. When customers return to the site, the site knows who they are and can personalize the visit to that site. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile uses cookies to collect information to improve and personalize our services and make suggestions to customers. In most cases your computer will provide you with the ability to clear cookies and to disable cookies (this depends on the browser you are using).
25.4.2. When you log in to the web site or use your phone, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile recognizes your identity. Independently of cookies, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may personalize your experience and suggestions on the web site or on your phone.
25.4.3. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may also place Web beacons on its site in conjunction with cookies to monitor how visitors are navigating and/or interacting with the site. A Web beacon is a small, sometimes transparent graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor the address and other information of the user visiting the Web site or sending or responding to the e-mail. Web beacons are used within the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile service as follows:
I. When the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long and the type of browser that retrieved the image.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile uses Web beacons to improve its site design and operational and business practices over time.
III. In some, but not all, computers and phones, turning off the browser’s cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user’s activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the information unique to the user will not be recorded.
25.5. IP ADDRESSES
IP addresses are used in the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile service as follows:
I. An IP address allows information to be sent to and from a computer (or a phone or other device) on the Internet. IP addresses are often temporarily assigned. Temporarily assigned addresses are assigned to a user for a period of time so the user typically does not have the same address each time they use the service. If a user is using a permanent IP address (more common with servers than mobile, dial-up, DSL or cable Internet users), they will have the same address each time they use the service. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile collects IP addresses when people access our Web site.
II. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile phones receive temporary IP addresses when they use data services. These addresses are reassigned after each data session. IP addresses from CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile phones are hidden from third parties you visit. These third parties cannot collect CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile IP addresses.
25.6. CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION
Customers have a right, and CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile has a duty, under the law to ensure the confidentiality of CPNI. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may use customer CPNI to market additional communications and data products and services similar to the types currently purchased from us. Again subject to your permission, CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may contact you to market additional products and services we and our partners sell.
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile also discloses customer CPNI as required by law (see “Information Sharing and Disclosure” above). And, to provide service, we may use and disclose CPNI to our agents and independent contractors, but we restrict their use and limit disclosure of CPNI for purposes of providing service or to market products and services as previously described. We will also prohibit the third party from further disclosing the CPNI except as required by law and will require the third party to implement safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the CPNI.
25.7. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile works to safeguard your personally identifiable information. CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile limits access to personally identifiable information about our customers to employees who we believe reasonably need to use that information to provide products or services to our customers or in order to do their jobs.
I. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about our customers.
II. We use technologies to safeguard personal information including:
a. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
b. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
c. Password protection of systems containing personally identifiable information.
III. As with any Web site, the security of information also depends on the safe computing practices of its customers. We strongly recommend that all CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile customers:
a. should use strong passwords that are not easily guessed for system access
b. should not share passwords with others
c. should not respond to e-mails or text messages asking for password information.
25.8 CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile may update this policy from time to time if our practices change or if changes in the law require us to do so. We will notify customers about significant changes in the policy by sending a notice to the primary e-mail address specified in the CANPAC REALTIME NETWORK Mobile account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
